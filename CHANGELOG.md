# Changelog

## 0.1.0

### Features

- Initial release. Pi coding agent extension that authenticates against
  Anthropic using your existing Claude Code credentials — no separate login
  or API key needed.
- Reads OAuth credentials from the macOS Keychain (all
  `Claude Code-credentials*` entries) with automatic multi-account detection,
  falling back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on all platforms.
- Seeds and syncs credentials into pi's `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` so pi uses
  them with zero separate login. Background re-sync runs every 5 minutes.
- Refreshes expiring tokens directly via Anthropic's OAuth endpoint (zero LLM
  tokens consumed), falling back to the Claude CLI, and writes rotated tokens
  back to the Keychain or credentials file.
- Account switcher via `/login anthropic` when multiple Claude Code accounts
  are detected; selection persists across sessions.
- Diagnostic logging via `PI_CLAUDE_AUTH_DEBUG` with automatic secret
  redaction.
